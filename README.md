Week 1

After reading your comment about a server being needed I decided not to attempt to have the user upload an image. Instead I chose one image to work out the kinks This week my goal was set two containers. One was for the reference image and another for the scrambled image. However, I first needed to figure out how to seperate the image into a 3 by 3 grid. I was trying to use javascript/jquery intially but was not able make an array. Then I tried using canvas but was very confused because we had not used it in class. Finally, I tried to use CSS but to no avail. After reading comments under tutorials I came across CSS sprites but it seemed like that was more so for putting and image together rather than splitting it. I was hoping the console would help guide me but there were not a issues other than simple unknown file errors that were fixed.

Week 2

This week I was able to fix the image so that it not only is together but stays in formation even when the width of the browser changes. I was also able to make it so that each tile on the picture puzzle had its own cordinate for reference in the Javascript file. In addition, I was able to make it so that the tiles shuffle once the "shuffle" button is clicked. I was not able to make the actual tiles respond. I looked at several tutorials but was unsure how to make them work with the code I already had in place. Some of them also required outside files that I had no knowledge of or could not access.

Week 3

This week my task was to make the puzzle move but for some reason the tutorials that I have been using never do. I think it may be compatibility issues with the code because most times the author of the tutorial started a different from how I did. Because I am not getting any debugging error I am thinking that the issue comes from a selector not being properly referenced or a variable that is not filled. I've looked for youtube tutorials but have not found any specific to what I am doing. I also noticed this week that whenever I tried to incorporate code from a tutorial the shuffle button was would stop working.
