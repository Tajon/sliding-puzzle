Week 1

After reading your comment about a server being needed I decided not to attempt to have the user upload an image. Instead I chose one image to work out the kinks This week my goal was set two containers. One was for the reference image and another for the scrambled image. However, I first needed to figure out how to seperate the image into a 3 by 3 grid. I was trying to use javascript/jquery intially but was not able make an array. Then I tried using canvas but was very confused because we had not used it in class. Finally, I tried to use CSS but to no avail. After reading comments under tutorials I came across CSS sprites but it seemed like that was more so for putting and image together rather than splitting it. I was hoping the console would help guide me but there were not a issues other than simple unknown file errors that were fixed.
